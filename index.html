        <p class="intro">
            Dear Rajesh,
        </p>

        <p class="body">
            Thank you for your recent application to join the Department of Robotics Engineering at Technovation Institute. 
            We were thrilled to learn about your enthusiasm for robotics and artificial intelligence, and I am excited to
            address your queries in detail below.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Program Starting Dates</h3>
        <p class="body">
            We offer flexible start dates for our Ph.D. program, with three main intakes per year:
        </p>
        <ul class="dates-list">
            <li><span class="highlight">Winter Semester:</span> Starts on 8 January 2025</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Spring Semester:</span> Starts on 4 May 2025</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Fall Semester:</span> Starts on 12 September 2025</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">
            While you can join at any time, starting at the beginning of a semester is highly recommended for seamless onboarding
            and access to resources. Please let us know your preferred starting date.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Proposed Research Areas</h3>
        <p class="body">
            We were impressed by your proposed research topics, particularly the following:
        </p>
        <ol class="research-areas">
            <li>Development of humanoid robots capable of self-repair.</li>
            <li>AI-driven robotic arms for precision surgical operations.</li>
            <li>Theoretical frameworks for robot-to-robot communication in autonomous systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="body">
            Could you please provide us with a detailed plan for each of these ideas? Include timelines, required facilities,
            estimated funding, and any external collaborations you foresee.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
            We look forward to your response and would be delighted to welcome you to the Technovation Institute.
